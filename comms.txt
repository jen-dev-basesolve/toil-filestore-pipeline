what is a job in toil?
- 

----------------------
What is stream in job.fileStore.writeGlobalFileStream?




---------------------------
There is a option for deleting the file from filestore.
  
# Delete the first file from the global file-store.
> $ job.fileStore.deleteGlobalFile(fileID)

---------------------------

External files can be imported & exported into the filestore using -

toil.common.Toil.importFile(), and 
toil.common.Toil.exportFile() 


-------------------------------
Different methods in fileStore

createFileStore()
shutdownFileStore()

open(job)
- Create the context manager around tasks prior and after a job has been run.
- Q. what is a context manager and what does it do?
	- Toil.Runner is a context manager. A context manager is used to start or restart the workflow.


getLocalTempDir()
- Get a new local temporary directory in which to write files.
- The directory will only persist for the duration of the job.

writeGlobalFile(localFileName, cleanup=False)
- Upload a file (as a path) to the job store.
- cleanup (bool) : "if True then the copy of the global file will be deleted once 
				the job and all its successors have completed running. If not the global file 
				must be deleted manually."


deleteLocalFile(fileStoreID)
- Delete local copies of files associated with the provided job store ID.
- Raises an OSError with an errno of errno.ENOENT if no such local copies exist. 
- Thus, cannot be called multiple times in succession.

deleteGlobalFile(fileStoreID)
- Delete local files and then permanently deletes them from the job store.
- To ensure that the job can be restarted if necessary, the delete will not 
  happen until after the job’s run method has completed.



------------------------------

What are streams in Python ?
- Streams are high-level async/await-ready primitives to work with network connections. 
- Streams allow sending and receiving data without using callbacks or low-level protocols and transports.


What are callbacks?
- Callback is a instruction to application to execute a piece of code on some event like click.



----------------------------------

What is the __init__ method?
- This method is only used inside class
- Its only use is to instantiate object attributes of class when a class is called.


--------------------------

Note - In toil you can directly start a class using Toil.start()

-----------------------

What is Root job in Toil?
- All workflows start from a single job, that job is the root job. The return value of the root job is returned as them
  result of the workflow. Promises are used in root jobs.


  -------------------

  toil.job.Job.Runner.addToilOptions() - This method can be used add options to the parser from code itself.

  ------------------------
Job.wrapFn(func_name,options)
- This is used to directly convert a function to a job.

---------------------

What is a job function?
- A function whose first argument is a job, just like a self argument in class. To wrap this function into a job a Job.wrapJobFn() is used.


------------------------

How do you make print statements work inside a job?
- Add logLevel='Debug' in the code.

----------------------------
How to view graphs in toil?


What is promised requirements and how is it different from promises?
What do promised requirements help us achieve?

What exactly is a job store ?

------------------------------
What is dynamic job creation?
- In dynamic job creation, childjobsFn of itself are called from the parent function. Depth is monitored by providing it as a option and then reducing
it after each level.


---------------------------

What is promise?
- Promise is to return a value before its evaluation. It is given by job.rv()

----------------------------

What is FileID?
- It is a string and it represents the file's Id in ' file store.
- FileID has a size attributes. This attribute stores file size in bytes.
- This FileID object is returned by 2 functions
	- importFile()
	- writeGlobalFile()
- filestore is an attribute of job argument, eg job.filestore

Global stores
- filestore allows for the creation of files that are globally accessible.


---------------------------

What does readGlobalFile() function do ?

--------------------

static createFileStore(jobStore, jobDesc, file_store_dir, waitForPreviousCommit, caching)
Create a concreate FileStore.

Parameters
jobStore (AbstractJobStore) –

jobDesc (JobDescription) –

file_store_dir (str) –

waitForPreviousCommit (Callable[[], Any]) –

caching (Optional[bool]) –

Return type
Union[NonCachingFileStore, CachingFileStore]



- Explain what is meant by callable[[], Any] for waitForPreviousCommit argument
- What is AbstractJobStore and how to access its value 

---------------------------------

What is meant by global file and local files in toil?


---------------------------------
Things we can do with the help of filestore API

1: copy a local file data into a filestore file using job.fileStore.writeGlobalFile('localfilepath') - This function returns FileID
2: export the file using toil.export(fileID,destination=)
3: getLocalTempDir - create a temporary directory, getLocalTempFile - create temporary file
4: deleteGlobalFile and deleteLocalFile


Things we can not do
1: Make local singularity containers, interact with these temporary files. They are not able to find temp files.
